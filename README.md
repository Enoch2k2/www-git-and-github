# GIT AND GITHUB
## GITHUB

Github is designed for project management. It's a place on the internet for us to host our own projects for collaboration with other developers and managing our projects.

#### Branches
In a way Github also tells the story of how your project was created and how the developers added to it.

Branches allow us to safely added features to our project. We can switch to a branch in github add a change. If we don't like that change, we can move out of that branch and delete it to start over without harming our project.

Github is also like a tree where you can see kind of a timeline of what was added and what branches added what features.
```
        links-> added navigation bar-> 
master->                             merged with master
```

Here this tells the story of how in the project, you switched to the branch called links, added a navigation bar, it was successful so it was merged with master branch.
