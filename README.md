# GIT AND GITHUB
## GITHUB

Github is designed for project management. It's a place on the internet for us to host our own projects for collaboration with other developers and managing our projects. This is also known as our remote repository.

#### Branches
In a way Github also tells the story of how your project was created and how the developers added to it.

Branches allow us to safely added features to our project. We can switch to a branch in github add a change. If we don't like that change, we can move out of that branch and delete it to start over without harming our project.

Github is also like a tree where you can see kind of a timeline of what was added and what branches added what features.
```
        links-> added navigation bar-> 
master->                             merged with master
```

Here this tells the story of how in the project, you switched to the branch called links, added a navigation bar, it was successful so it was merged with master branch.

#### Commits

Commiting to your repo is another way of creating a timeline within a branch. Whenever you commit all of your work is basically saved to what we call an SHA key.

You add the files you want to save to your commit and give your commit a message describing a summerized detail on what you added.

You can modify your github directly on github by clicking the edit button while viewing a file in your github file tree. Once edited you can give it a commit message and save it which will automatically, however the best practice is using `git commands` in your terminal. If you have a local setup you can use your computers terminal. If you are using the `learn ide`. You will need the downloaded version and will be using the `temperary` directory as the root for creating your project.

You can view all of your commits by clicking on the commits link above the branch dropdown (which is above the file tree) in github to view all of your commits done in that branch.
